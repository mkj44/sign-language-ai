🧠 Sign Language AI

An AI-based project developed as part of Design Thinking & Methodology (DTM) to help bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and the general public by recognizing sign language using artificial intelligence.

⸻

📌 Problem Statement

People who use sign language often face communication barriers because most people do not understand sign gestures. This leads to social isolation and difficulty in daily interactions.

⸻

💡 Solution

Sign Language AI is a smart system that:
	•	Detects hand gestures
	•	Interprets sign language
	•	Converts signs into understandable text/output

This project focuses on using AI and computer vision concepts to make communication more inclusive and accessible.

⸻

🎯 Objectives
	•	To recognize basic sign language gestures
	•	To convert hand signs into readable text
	•	To promote inclusive communication using AI
	•	To apply Design Thinking methodology in solving a real-world problem

⸻

🔍 Design Thinking Approach (DTM)
	1.	Empathize – Understanding challenges faced by hearing-impaired people
	2.	Define – Communication gap due to lack of sign language awareness
	3.	Ideate – AI-based gesture recognition system
	4.	Prototype – Sign language detection model
	5.	Test – Evaluating recognition accuracy and usability
